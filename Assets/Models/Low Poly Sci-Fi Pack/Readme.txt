Included in this pack is a textures folder for a series of tilable materials which contains:

- OpenGL Normal
- Ambient Occlusion
- Curvature
- Albedo Mask

The intention is for you to use the Red, Green, and Blue channels of the albedo mask map 
to mask the primary, secondary, and third colors of the texture you would like use in 
your render or game engine of choice.  An example of this setup can be found in the .blend
file shader editor where the color channels are split up and used as masks.  

Should you not wish to use this recommended setup, a folder with pre-baked albedo textures
(with recommended colors) is also included which may be quicker to start working with.  

I wish you the best of luck working with these assets in your projects.  
Thank you :)
